## Choose your path in life

Our future is like a thundering cloud and we can barely see 5 foot into it.

Yet like fireflies drawn to light I can't help myself but be anxious as we wade through it in the present.

I am writing this immediately after being reminded of the cold ruthlessness of corporate America and the reduction of brilliant humans to mere numbers on a paper.
Everyday, without fail, I overthink and prepare for a thousand different scenarios.

I have learnt that the world is a big scary place. If you aren’t careful and if you let it, 

### it chews u up and spits you out. 

My heart weeps for people who dont make it to the other side. 

Of people beseech by circumstances not of their own doing. 

Of empires built but battles lost. 

Of promises made but were empty after

##  Everyone is trying their best. 

they teach us in computer science that greedy algorithm works; make decisions that benefit the local maxima and it generally should turn out fine. 

In the response to chaos the first instinct for humans is usually to control.

Ironically, the only thing I believe we can control is how we want to walk our path in life. Today, I am more confident of my choices then ever before.

### I’ll choose to be kind. 

### I’ll choose to be present. 

### I’ll choose to be human.

I love you all. 

Never kill yourself.
