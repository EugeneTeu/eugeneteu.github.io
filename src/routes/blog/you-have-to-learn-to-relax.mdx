# You have to learn to Relax
By Eugene Teu

## You Need to Learn to Relax or the Stress Will Fucking Kill You Before the Thing That is Supposed to Kill You Gets the Chance

Always found it very difficult to truly be... relaxed, to slow down and take the pedal off the metal.
I turn 28 this year and I can't point to the last time I truly felt like I had nothing on my mind.

Relaxing is a fantasy reserved for others.

## I'm not high agency. I'm high anxiety.

It is a miracle I made it to where I am today in life.
Most days feels like I am a hair width's away from exploding.
Most days I keep it together. I think I done a pretty good job of facing the world and trudging forward.

In heavy currents, motion forward calm the senses.

## Life Is Suffering

One of the four noble truth in buddhism is that life is suffering, or dukkha. I resonate with this.
I have come to terms that I will never run away from who I am.

I am destined to suffer a lifetime of the demons in my head, the inner voice who speaks.
Most days it is kind to me. Some days it is not.

May I one day learn to relax.

Whoever you are, I wish you peace.
