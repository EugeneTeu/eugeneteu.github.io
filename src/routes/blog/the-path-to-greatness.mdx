# The path to greatness

By Eugene Teu

Just reflecting on the past 24 months and journey navigating my career. We made it fam.

## Relentless Execution, Unrelenting Belief

This past 2 years has taught me to
execute no matter what and keep moving forward, to be **relentless** in my **execution**.

We are never guaranteed the next day, nor entitled to any success, but yet
have that **unrelenting belief** in yourself and trust yourself to succeed.

## A tomorrow is never guaranteed

Never be attached to the expected outcomes of your actions. External circumstances are out of your control.
Let go of the entitlement of success. Instead, choose to embark on the path to greatness

## Greatness is intangible

Greatness is not the job promotion, the numbers in your bank account or the car you drive. Greatness is
found in the little sliver of your everyday behaviour. Its found between the folds of your mental psyche as
you rise each day over every single **challenge**.

Greatness is showing up for the people who support you. Greatness is striving to never let them down.
Greatness is waking up everyday and putting your best foot forward.

Greatness is moving ahead even when you're scared to death, to do right by the people and family around you.

### It's about the consistent, courageous integrity woven into the fabric of our daily life.

Eugene Teu, 2025
