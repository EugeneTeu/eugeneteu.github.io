# I am not long for this world
By Eugene Teu

## I’m not long for this world

I been thinking about the end.

When all is said and done.

What will people say.

## I’m grateful

For this life is a privilege.

A smooth and comfortable life.

Full of love and warmth

## I’m coming up against a Glass Ceiling

Some days it feels as if I reached the ceiling.

This is all that will ever be.

And all that ever was.

## When it is my time to go

May my body give up before my time is up.

Let my soul rest against the glass ceiling.

I’m not long for this world.
