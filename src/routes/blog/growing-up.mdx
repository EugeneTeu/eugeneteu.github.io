# Growing up
By Eugene Teu

I have lived in the same house since I was a boy. My sister moved out today. Soon I will too.

The hallway, once alive with our laughter, will now fall silent.

### I don’t want to grow up. I’m a Toys R Us kid.

A mother who chose to stay home.

A father who worked to light our nights.

A childhood given, so precious.

A home built, so full of love.

May I one day build a home as warm as theirs

### I don’t want to grow up. I’m a Toys R Us kid

Leaving the room I had since I was a young teen.

The walls have seen my greatest defeats and my most beautiful victories.

### I don’t want to grow up. I’m a Toys R us kid.

I’m leaving the coop.

I love you
